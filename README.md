# Zachary Rodeheffer - Project Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Zachary Rodeheffer. I have 3+ years of analytical experience in developing analyses within Python and R and utilize these skills almost every day as a Product Analyst. I have a Masters Degree in Business Analytics from UW - Madison and that's where my passion for all things data stems from. On top of digging deep into data within Python and R, I also love the problem solving that comes with retrieving data using SQL. I consider myself an advanced user and have created many complex queries for business needs through my work experience in Business Intelligence. On top of Python, R, and SQL I also have dashbaording experience putting together data products for business stakeholders utilizing Tableau and Looker Studio. The goal of this portfolio is to showcase some of those skills.

Outside of work I have many personal projects that I have completed to help my understanding related to sports and daily fantasty sports/sports betting. Nothing frustrates me more than making decisions without some data to back it up. I have found these personal projects to be the area where I learn and grow the most. Every single project stems from a question I have and that question often leads to me discovering new methodolgies and packages to add to my data analysis toolkit.

This repository is meant to showcase skills in proper data handling and data analysis and share projects that I am passionate about. This repository also helps keep me accountable and helps track my growth in data analysis. 

Above, you can see my first polished project "Predictive Shot Model" which utilizes machine learning to predict the total shots an NHL player will have in a game.
